- [The number protocol](../../../reference/concepts/the_sequence_protocol.md)
- [The sequence protocol](../../../reference/concepts/the_sequence_protocol.md)
- [The stream protocol](../../../reference/concepts/the_sequence_protocol.md)
- [The random protocol](../../../reference/concepts/the_sequence_protocol.md)
- [The linear order protocol](../../../reference/concepts/the_sequence_protocol.md)
- [The associative mapping protocol](../../../reference/concepts/the_sequence_protocol.md)
