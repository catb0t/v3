# Applicative programming

"Applicative" vs "Concatenative" is one of many ways to classify programming paradigms. The vast majority of popular languages are _applicative_: things are evaluated by applying [functions](../concepts/functions.md) to arguments.

In applicative programming, [function composition](../concepts/function_composition.md) is achieved by applying functions to the outputs of other functions.

## Sub-paradigms

Applicative languages may be any or none of the following:

- [Logic Programming](./logic.md)

- [Object Oriented Programming](./object-oriented.md)


- [Functional Programming](./functional.md)
- [Procedural Programming](./procedural.md)


- [Declarative Programming](./functional.md)
- [Imperative Programming](./functional.md)

## Concepts

Concepts that are integral to the applicative model:

- [Assignment](../concepts/scope.md)
- [Operators](../concepts/operators.md)
- [Return values](../concepts/operators.md)
- [Scope](../concepts/scope.md)
- [Variables](../concepts/operators.md)
