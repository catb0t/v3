# Stack-oriented programming

Stack-oriented programming relies on a [data (or operand) stack](../concepts/data_stack.md) as the primary set of values upon which almost all operations and evaluations are performed.

Many programming languages, including non-stack-oriented ones, use _call stacks_ as an implementation detail to allow recursion and exception handling, but these are distinct from the _data stack_.

In imperative programming, a programmer may store a value by assigning a name to it, and later referring to that name.

In stack-oriented programming, values are stored on the top of the stack, where it will be accessed and transformed by functions.
